# The Master Seach Telegram Bot

> In this project, I built a Telegram Bot that can search on Wikipedia or get you 3 random Wikipedia articles. It also sends you random funny Gifs every time you write something else in the chat or you use the /start and /stop commands. The main goal is to make a massive use of external API`s by putting into practice the main concepts of Object Oriented Programming, classes, modules, objects and accessing their attributes.<br>
> The project is built using the TDD technique.

## The Bot is live, you can check him here: [Master Search Bot](http://t.me/master_search_ruby_bot)

## You can see a short demo of the Bot /start command in the screenshot below.
